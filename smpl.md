**NOTE**
This reference guide is in work-in-progress state. We are planning to release version 1.0 by end of 2022.

This document describes the _Simple Math Programming Language (SMPL)_.

SMPL is a math-oriented programming language that can be interpreted in the browser. Its primary use is for the _mathe:buddy app_.

SMPL is (mostly) an imperative, typed language. Its syntax is basically a subset of _JavaScript_, but extends with intrinsic mathematical data types (e.g. terms, sets and matrices) and operator overloading for these types.

The language definition of SMPL is independent of concrete implementations.
A reference implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/mathebuddy/mathebuddy-smpl).
Visit our online [playground](https://mathebuddy.github.io/mathebuddy-smpl/).

SMPL is heavily used by the [mathe:buddy language](https://app.f07-its.fh-koeln.de/docs-mbl.html).

### History Notes

Many concepts (and also parts of the source code) are taken from the _Simple E-Learning Language_ [SELL](https://sell.f07-its.fh-koeln.de).
Compared to SELL, SMPL is _Turing Complete_, but lacks an interactive e-learning environment.

## First Example

The following example program creates two $3 \times 3$-matrices $A$ and $B$, with random (integral) entries in range [-5,5] without zero.
Both matrices are numerically unequal. The product of $A$ and $B$ is finally assigned to variable $C$.

```
let A/B = randZ<3,3>(-5,5);
let C = A * B;
```

The example demonstrates some of the key features of SMPL:

- very short syntax
- flexible randomization functions
- operator overloading

The following _Python_ program is similar to the two lines of SMPL code above (but not semantically equivalent, since it generates zero-elements in some cases).

```python
import numpy
A = numpy.round(numpy.random.rand(3,3)*10) - 5
while True:
  B = numpy.round(numpy.random.rand(3,3)*10) - 5
  if not numpy.array_equal(A,B):
    break
C = numpy.matmul(A, B)
```

## Programs

An SMPl program is a sequence of statements $p=(s_0 ~s_1 \dots)$.
Each statements ends by a semicolon (`;`).
Declarations and assignments are executed statement wise, i.e. $s_{i+1}$ is executed after statement $s_i$.

Example:

```
let x = 3;
let y = sin(x);
```

The example programs executes lines one and two in given order.
Each line is evaluated, before the next line is executed.
Indeed, we also could write all statements in one line, since the semicolon separates statements.

- The first line evaluates the right-hand side of the equal sign (`=`) and assigns the result, here `3`, to a new variable with identifier `x`. The type of variable `x` is `integer`.

- The second line first evaluates the expression `sin(x)`. Variable `x` is taken as argument to the sine function. The numeric result `0.14111..` is stored to variable `y` of data type `real`. It has double-precision (refer to IEEE 754). Take care, that real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ are stored approximately, unless symbolic computation is applied explicitly.

## Data Types

boolean (`BOOL`), integer (`INT`), rational (`RATIONAL`), real (`REAL`), term (`TERM`), matrix (`MATRIX`), vector (`VECTOR`), set (`SET`), complex (`COMPLEX`).

## Declarations

Declarations are initiated with keyword `let`, followed by an identifier and finally assigned expression by `=`.
The expression in the right-hand side is mandatory to derive the data type.

> Example

```
let x = 5;
let y = 7, z = 9.1011;
let u = rand(5);
let v = zeros<2,3>();
let a : b = rand<3,3>(-2, 2);
let c :/ d :/ e = rand<3,3>(-2, 2);
```

- Variables `x` and `u` are integral. The value for `u` is randomly chosen from set {0,1,2,3,4,5}.
- Variable `z` is a real valued.
- Variables `x` and `z` are declared together (without any semantical relation). The notation is equivalent to `let y=7; let y=9.1011;`
- Variables `v`, `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are matrices. `v` is a zero matrix with two rows and three columns.
- Matrices `a` and `b` consist of randomly chosen, integral elements in range [-2,2].
- The colon separator `:` evaluates the right-hand side to each of the variables: `let a = rand<3,3>(-2, 2); let b = rand<3,3>(-2, 2);`. Accordingly, elements for `a` and `b` are drawn individually.
- Separator `:/` guarantees that no pair of matrices `c`, `d` and `e` is equal.

## Expressions

List of operators, ordered by increasing precedence:

| Operator           | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\|\|`             | Logical Or                                               |
| `&&`               | Logical And                                              |
| `==`,`!=`          | Equal, Unequal                                           |
| `<`, `<=`,`>`,`>=` | Less than, Less or equal, Greater than, Greater or equal |
| `+`, `-`           | Addition, Subtraction                                    |
| `*`, `/`           | Multiplication, Division                                 |
| `^`                | Potency                                                  |
| `++`, `--`         | Postfix Incrementation, Decrementation                   |

Base data types are evaluated at compile-time. Properties like e.g. matrix dimensions are evaluated at runtime.
Thus, a `RuntimeError` is thrown if e.g. two matrices with a different number of rows are added.

> Example

```
let x = 1.23 * sin(y) + exp(u + 2*w);
let C = A * B^T;
let d = det(C);
```

- The examples assumes, that variables `y`, `u`, `w`, `A`, `B`, `C` have been declared before usage.

## Conditions

> Example

```
let s = 0;
if (x > 0) {
  s=1;
}
else if (x < 0) {
  s = -1;
}
else {
  x=0;
}
```

## Loops

> Example

```
while (x > 0) {
  // body
}
```

> Example

```
do {
  // body
} while (x > 0);
```

> Example

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // body
}
```

## Functions

A function consists of a **header** and a **body**:

- The **header** declared the name of the function, its parameter names and types and the return type.
- The **body** is represented by a list of statements and returns a result that is compatible to the return type.

> Example

```
function f(x: INT, y: INT): INT {
  return x + y;
}

let y = f(3, 4);
```

## Appendix: Grammar

The following formal grammar (denoted in EBNF) is currently implemented.

```EBNF
program = { statement };
statement = declaration | if | for | do | while | switch | function | return | break | continue | expression EOS;
declaration = "let" id_list "=" expr EOS | "let" ID "(" ID { "," ID } ")" "=" expr EOS;
id_list = ID { ":" ID } | ID { "/" ID };
expression = or { ("="|"+="|"-="|"/=") or };
or = and { "||" and };
and = equal { "&&" equal };
equal = relational [ ("=="|"!=") relational ];
relational = add [ ("<="|">="|"<"|">") add ];
add = mul { ("+"|"-") mul };
mul = pow { ("*"|"/") pow };
pow = unary [ "^" unary ];
unary = unaryExpression [ unaryPostfix ];
unaryExpression = "true" | "false" | INT | IMAG | REAL | "(" expr ")" | ID | "-" unary | "!" unary;
unaryPostfix = "++" | "--" | [ "<" [ unary { "," unary } ] ">" ] "(" [ expr { "," expr } ] ")" | "[" expr "]";
for = "for" "(" expression ";" expression ";" expression ")" block;
if = "if" "(" expression ")" block [ "else" block ];
block = statement | "{" { statement } "}";
do = "do" block "while" "(" expr ")" EOS;
while = "while" "(" expr ")" block;
switch = "switch" "(" expr ")" "{" { "case" INT ":" { statement } } "default" ":" { statement } "}";
function = "function" ID "(" [ ID { "," ID } ] ")" block;
return = "return" [ expr ] EOS;
break = "break" EOS;
continue = "continue" EOS;
```
